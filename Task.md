# Weather console Task

Cool developers don't have to waste time and look out of the window to see the current weather conditions. We want tools for that!

## 1. Your task

Write a **PHP-based command line app** which prints the current weather of any city which you specify as argument.

E.g. ```weather London```

should print something like ```Light clouds, 20 degrees celcius```

So at least your app should print
* the overall weather conditions as text
* the current temperature in degrees celcius

## 2. Your data source

Please use the OpenWeatherMap API https://openweathermap.org/api. You can use this key: ```c0f764ce5e4c25576b8d6325fc223810```

## 3. Some remarks

* We're interested in your code and not only in the actual result. Of course it should meet the above specifications, but you don't have to waste time on making the output pretty or add more functionality. Impress us with your code!
* A framework is not necessary to complete this task, so please try to avoid using one. Of course you can use composer packages.
* Your code should be documented (text, no diagrams). How you document it is up to you.
* The used PHP-Version should be >= 7.3, using some its latest features available. A docker based solution is preferred, but not mandatory.
* We love tests. Please show us if you are able to write at least one or two meaningful test for this app! No need for 100% coverage.
* Your code has to be formatted in PSR-2.
